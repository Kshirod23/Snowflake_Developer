Do you know cache in snowflake?
---------------------------------
cache is a temporary storage location that stores copies of files or copies of data 
so that they can be accessed faster in near future.
it is nothing but a temporary storage location where it can hold some data or it can hold some files
so that whenever we want to use those files in near future like in next 24 hours or in next two days
so  we can access them in a faster manner 

so in Snowflake this cache plays a important role in Saving cost and speeding up the results while we re execute a queries.
it improves the query performance a lot .

There are two types of catches available in Snowflake one is query results cache and the other one is local disk cache .
1.results cache
2.local disk cache
