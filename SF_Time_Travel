There are three ways to access time travel 
  1. by using query ID
  2. by using offset
  3. by using timestamp 
  --by using three ways we can able to access the historical data by using query ID offset and a time stamp.
Q3. what is Syntax for time travel ?



okay how to access this
0:48
time travel so select start from table
0:50
it will give the active data but I want
0:52
to access the historical data how can I
0:54
access by using before statement query
0:58
ID or by using offset or by using time
1:00
stem so it will give select St from EMP
1:03
will the latest data but I want to
1:05
access the historical data with the help
1:06
of time that is before statement query
1:09
ID or by using offset or by using time
1:13
stamp same thing next question is that
1:16
what so what are the session specific
1:19
tables okay see temper tables are called
1:21
as session specific tables it will be
1:24
available for the particular session so
1:26
data will be available for the
1:28
particular session it data will not be
1:29
available to the other sessions next
1:32
question is that what so types of tables
1:35
in Snowflake there are permanent table
1:37
transcent table and temporary tables
1:40
these are called snowflake internal
1:42
tables so by default when you create any
1:44
table permanent table will be created so
1:47
transcent table temporary table these
1:49
are the snowflake internal tables so
1:51
data will be stored inside snowlake and
1:54
next question is that what how to
1:56
disable time so supp like I want some
1:59
tables to disable the time travel so how
2:01
can you put alter table table name set
2:05
data retention time index equal to zero
2:09
so by default for all the tables it will
2:11
be one day so we are disabling with the
2:12
help of zero alter table table name set
2:17
data redention time index equal to zero
2:20
next question is that what okay see when
2:23
fail sa starts so answer is that what
2:25
once time travels the data mve to the
2:28
fail save so this is Av for only
2:30
permanent table once the time TR ends
2:32
for the permanent table the data will
2:34
move to the fail safe next question is
2:37
that what how to undrop a table so supp
2:40
like I drop a table by mistake but I
2:42
want to rest the table so by using what
2:44
parameter Bing undrop command undrop
2:48
table table name how to Reg table by
2:50
saying undrop table table name okay next
2:54
question is that what what is fail safe
2:56
period of transend table so remember so
2:59
transend table doesn't have fail sa the
3:01
answer is zero zero because fail sa is
3:04
not available for transcent tables and
3:06
temporary tables next question is that
3:09
so what is default retention time of
3:11
tables okay so for all like permanent
3:13
table transcent tables and tempor tables
3:16
so default retention time is what it is
3:18
one day one day okay same thing next
3:20
question is that what what is fail safe
3:23
period of permanent table so once time
3:25
tolerance data will move to the fail
3:27
save so this is available for only
3:30
tables how long it will it is Av for 7
3:33
Days okay hope this is clear so if you
