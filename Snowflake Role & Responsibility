How you are pushing changes to prod ?

After development and unit testing, we used to checkin ddl, dml and python files in GitHub 
prod folder and a change request we are creating where we mentioned what all activities to be 
followed for prod deployment. Release team they used to promote dev codes to prod.


I majorly work closely with the Snowflake cloud data platform to design, 
develop, and maintain data solutions that enable efficient data storage, processing, and analysis.
Basically in this project my role is creating Database,Schema,tables,views,materialized views.
For ETL process we are using python as a ETL tool.
To Extract data from different diff sources like pre-prod database and Dev-database.
In this process I used to writing SQl queries in python envirnment to extract the data.
That data load through SNOWSQL I used to PUT command in Snowsql command line to snowflake internal staging area.
then after i Used to load data from stageing area to snowflake permanent table using COPY command.
Before data load i used to
