Q1.What is zero copy cloning?

zero copy cloning is  snowflake feature which is used to create or take a snapshot of database,schema and table
main advantages of creating zero copy cloning is we can create multiple copies of same tables,database,schemas
and no additional cost is assosiate with cloning object, thats why it is called zero copy cloning.
Both cloned object and source object are share same storage.

In traditional databases if we create copy of a table,if that table have million million of records it takes additional storage. 
both source table and copy table share different storages that's why additional cost will be assosiate with copy table.
