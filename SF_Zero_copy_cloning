Q1.What is zero copy cloning?

zero copy cloning is  snowflake feature which is used to create or take a snapshot of database,schema and table
main advantages of creating zero copy cloning is we can create multiple copies of same tables,database,schemas
and no additional cost is assosiate with cloning object, thats why it is called zero copy cloning.
Both cloned object and source object are share same storage.

In traditional databases if we create copy of a table,if that table have million million of records it takes additional storage. 
both source table and copy table share different storages that's why additional cost will be assosiate with copy table.


Cloning Syntax:
--------------
CREATE OR REPLACE 'CLONED_OBJECT_TYPE' 'CLONED_OBJECT_NAME' CLONE 'SOURCE_OBJECT';
EXAMPLE : Here database name is ADIDAS_DB, We want to clone this object

CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE ADIDAS_DB_CLONEDB CLONE ADIDAS_DB;


--Interview Question
--Does cloning object occupies Extra storage?
select * from test_clone_new;
select * from information_schema.table_storage_metrics
where table_catalog = 'adidas_db'
and table_schema = 'adidas_sc'
and table_name  in ('test','test_clone_new')
and table_dropped is null;



--Suppose if we insert a new record into the main table does it reflect in the clone table vice versa?
